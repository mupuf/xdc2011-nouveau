		\subsection{Role of the Foundation}
		\begin{frame}
			\begin{block}{}
				The X.Org Foundation is a company chartered to
develop and execute effective strategies that provide worldwide stewardship and
encouragement of the X Window System and related projects (Mesa, DRI, Wayland,
etc.).
			\end{block}

		\subsection{Actions of the Foundation}
		\begin{frame}
			\begin{block}{X.Org Developer's Conference (XDC/XDS)}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Organized once a year, in
October/September;
					\item Alternates between the US and
Europe (in Europe this year!);
					\item Lasts 3 days;
				\end{itemize}
			\end{block}

			\begin{block}{Travel sponsorship}
				The board of directors can cover the travel and
accomodation expenses to the developers who couldn't attend an X.org-related
conference (X.org or FOSDEM?).
			\end{block}
		\end{frame}

		\begin{frame}
			\begin{block}{Google Summer of Code (GSoC)}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item The X.org Foundation is an
approved org. of the GSoC;
					\item Allows students to participate to
X.org-related projects over the summer and get paid;
					\item Allowed us to get Render Nodes in
Linux (David Hermann), reverse engineer performance counters on NVIDIA cards
(Samuel Pitoiset), and get an initial implementation of
GL\_EXT\_direct\_state\_access (Dylan Noblesmith). At least the first two are
still
active!

% asking people to become members, present themselves as candidate for the board
% and vote
% I'll start with basically what you said at XDC, whot
% I'll try to write the slides soon so as I can get them approved
